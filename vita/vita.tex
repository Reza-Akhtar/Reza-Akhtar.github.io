% Notes:
%
% * THIS IS IMPORTANT.
%   Don't forget to change `pdfauthor' and `keywords' in the \hypersetup
%   section below. Lots of other people's CVs show up in Google when I type my
%   name because they didn't change these and my name is in their PDF metadata.
%
% * To create a new page use: \newpage \opening
%
% * res.cls includes an \address{} command which can be used up to twice,
%   but my address is too long for the format it uses.
%
% * Alternate documentclass statement to put headings in margin:
%   \documentclass[margin,line,11pt,final]{res}
%
% * Can divide publication/presentation list into subsections by year:
%   \section{\bf\small\hspace{8mm}2006}

{\bf Undergraduate advising} \\
Since 2003, I have served as academic advisor for between five and twelve undergraduate students each year studying towards the B.S. in Mathematics.  I have completed the first four modules of the Advisor Training program and expect to be formally awarded Level B Advisor status within the next few weeks.  

{\bf Course development} \\

\begin{itemize} 

\item
Student Recognition of Teaching Excellence Award, Fall 2020.

\item
\underline{M. Pauline Priest Barney fellowship}, 2016-2017. \\
{\ss \indent This fellowship is given to a faculty member in the Department of Mathematics for the specific purpose of developing a new course or redesigning an existing mathematics course.  In Fall 2014, I was asked to develop a course to prepare Actuarial Science minors for the second exam (Financial Mathematics) in the sequence for professional licensure.  I taught this course (MTH 247) for the first time in Spring 2015.  I then used the fellowship to study what might be improved in future offerings of the course.  I taught the course again in Spring 2016.  Unfortunately, in Spring 2017 and Spring 2018, the class had to be canceled due to low enrollment; student demand was assessed to be too low to warrant even putting it on the schedule for Spring 2019 or 2020.}

\section{\bf SUMSRI Program}
\vspace {3 mm}
\normalsize

I was heavily involved in the Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (SUMSRI), from early in my career (2002) until discontinuation of the program in 2018.  SUMSRI was a seven-week long program, hosted by the Department of Mathematics at Miami University, whose goals was to encourage talented undergraduates -- particularly those from underrepresented demographic groups -- to pursue research and graduate education in the mathematical sciences.  Students recruited from universities across the country were given the opportunity to conduct research in a seminar under the direction of a faculty member in mathematics or statistics; each research seminar was assisted by a graduate student in the mathematical sciences who also served as a mentor to the undergraduates.  SUMSRI also offered a sequence of short courses, a colloquium series, and a graduate panel discussion featuring representatives from programs at universities in the general area.  Until 2014, students were also given funding to attend the annual Joint Mathematics Meetings the following January to present their research in poster form.  

\medskip

\underline{Program Director}: (2014, 2018) \\
{\ss I wrote the grant proposals, advertised the program, recruited students, and selected between eight and seventeen students (dependent on the level of funding) from an applicant pool of roughly 200 students each year.  I made offers and assigned students to research seminars.  I was also responsible for setting the program schedule, inviting colloquium speakers, and organizing other program events.}

\underline{Program Director and Coordinator}: (2015) \\
{\ss As for Program Director, with the additional responsibility of organizing travel for students, processing paychecks, and keeping accounts of all program expenses.}

\newpage
\underline{Program co-Director}: (2010 - 2013) \\
{\ss As for Program Director, except that duties were shared with Program co-Director Patrick Dowling (Department of Mathematics).}

\underline{Research Seminar Director}: (2003 - 2013) \\
{\ss During the seven weeks of the program, I met with an assigned group of four to seven students and supervised their 
research on a problem of my choosing.  The students wrote up their results in a final paper and delivered a final presentation.  In some cases (2008, 2010, 2013), the results were reworked and submitted for publication in a research journal.}

\underline{Algebra Short Course Instructor}: (2002, 2003, 2014, 2015) \\
{\ss I designed and delivered a course of 12 contact hours, on a topic in Algebra appropriate for junior-level Mathematics students.}

\section{\bf Departmental Service (major)}
\vspace{3 mm}
\normalsize
\underline{Associate Chair}: Fall 2016 - present. \\ 
{\ss Ongoing duties include designing and maintaining the department teaching schedule, managing student enrollment (ROR), and hearing/ruling upon academic dishonesty cases.  As part of this position, I have also designed and implemented a force add request management system (Spring 2017, prior to ROR), designed a research map for the department web page (Summer 2017), organized a department retreat (Fall 2017), and assembled an archive of course materials for the department (Spring - Summer 2019).}

\underline{Governance Committee}: Fall 2017 - present (Chair), 2008-09, 2006-07. \\
{\ss During the 2017-2018 and 2018-19 academic years, I worked with three other faculty members and in consultation with the department to produce a completely new governance document.  While many policies were borrowed from the old document, the new document is organized very differently, in a form designed for ease of use and updating.  Much work was necessary to eliminate redundancy, update obsolete statements, ensure consistent with university policy, and firm up various definitions.  The new document was adopted by the department in March 2019.}

\underline{Department self-study co-author}: Summer 2016. \\
{\ss I helped Patrick Dowling and Doug Ward write the department self-study document in advance of the program review conducted in October 2016.}

\underline{Chair of Department Tenure Committee}: Fall 2014 - Fall 2017.\\
{\ss My duties were to call and preside or meetings of the committee each Spring to discuss progress and write review letters for probationary faculty members.  During the fall, meetings were held to consider and vote upon applications for tenure and promotion to Associate Professor.}

\underline{Department Graduate Committee}: Fall 2007 - Spring 2014 and Fall 2001 - Spring 2004.\\
{\ss The Graduate Committee considers all issues pertinent to the department's graduate degree programs, including course approvals, curriculum changes, and assistantship offers to program applicants.}

\underline {Department web page}: design and maintenance, Fall 2009 - Spring 2014.\\
{\ss Prior to the uniformization of university web pages implemented in 2014, the department maintained its own website.  I wrote the code for those pages and updated the relevant information each year.}

\underline{Chair of Oxford Math lecturer search committee}: 2013-14.

\underline{Oxford Math tenure-track search committee}: 2016-17, 2014-15, 2011-12, 2002-03.

\underline{Hamilton tenure-track Math search committee}: 2009-10.

\underline{Mathematics Committee}: Chair 2006-08 and Secretary 2002-2006.\\
{\ss This committee, which was in existence from 2002 through 2009 in the (joint) department of Mathematics and Statistics, considered matters specific to mathematics and communicated a recommendation to the department.}

\underline{Chair of {\em ad hoc} Committee for Peer Review of Teaching}: Spring 2005.\\
{\ss This commitee devised a departmental policy for peer review of teaching (for tenure-track faculty), which was then approved by the department and incorporated into the governance document.}

\underline{Chair of {\em ad hoc} Online Teaching Evaluation Committee}: Spring 2012 and Fall 2013.\\
{\ss This committee was tasked with drafting or revising department-specific questions on form for student evaluation of teaching, as the university was transitioning from evaluations on paper to online evaluations.}
