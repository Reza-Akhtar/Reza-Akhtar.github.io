<p><b>Research Seminars.</b> The most important portion of the program
is the research seminars, where professional mathematicians and statisticians
contribute problems. At least one of the seminar leaders will be an African
American; the other two will be Miami faculty from either the Department
of Mathematics and Statistics or the Department of Systems Analysis. Before
arriving in Oxford, the students are mailed a card listing each seminar
area and prerequisites. They are asked to rank the topics and return the
card. They are then assigned an area based on their choice. We hope to
give each person his or her first choice, but this is not always possible.
During the first four weeks of the program, each seminar director presents
a series of lectures to the seminar participants in their area of expertise
and assign research problems. These problems are challenging and at the
same time easy enough for a very good undergraduate student to get partial
results. Each student chooses a problem to work on and consults the appropriate
professional. The seminar leaders are asked to meet with their students
every day except Friday during the first four weeks and at least twice
a week during the last three weeks. We strongly encourage students to work
in groups. At the end of the program, the students give an oral presentation
on their results and write a paper. The paper will be included in an online
journal published by the Institute.

seminars looking at topics in statistics, graph theory and algebra.

<td>Jennifer Everson, Melissa Hildt, Jason Popovic and Sarah Zimmermann
determined the desirability of living in any state by using a set of several
different variables.&nbsp; The multivariate statistical methods of factor
analysis and discriminant analysis lend themselves to this issue.&nbsp;
They used factor analysis to reduce a large number of variables to a smaller
set of common factors which describe state desirability.&nbsp; They then
used discriminant analysis to classify states according to their desirability
level based on a set of measured variables.</td>

<td>Jillian Martens, Lisa McGee, Christian Roldan Santos and Lisa Sparrgrove
investigated the properties of a mod 3 variation of the game "Lights Out"
played on an arbitrary graph or digraph, following work done by Craft,
Miller and Pritikin.&nbsp; They prove that there are<i> 2<sup>n-1 </sup></i>unwinnable
configuartion for trees with <i>n</i> vertices, and show a procedure to
derive and recognize these configurations.&nbsp; For each graph, they exhibit
a nontrivial initial configuration <i>X</i>, which is unwinnable.&nbsp;
They characterize which initial configurations are winnable on complete
graphs, complete bipartite graphs and acyclic digraphs, certain tournaments,
and some other graphs.</td>

<td>Khalilah Beal&nbsp; looked at variations of the original <i>Lights
Out</i> game for patterns of winnability.&nbsp; Varieties of move shapes
and grid sizes are considered, and general formulas for winnability are
obtained.&nbsp; When <i>H</i> is an <i>m x n</i> grid with a move shape
<b>p</b>,
there is created a puzzle space (<i>H</i>,<b>p</b>).&nbsp; (<i>H</i>,<b>p</b>)
is a vector space of patterns, called even-dominating sets, for the graph.&nbsp;
Both linear algebra (mod 2) and ad hoc methods are used in generating all
even-dominating sets.</td>

a new perspective.&nbsp; <i>J(n,k)</i> represents the position of the survivor
when <i>n</i> people are eliminated with a skip factor of <i>k</i>.&nbsp;
They demonstrate that there exists an explicit formula for <i>J(n,k)</i>
when <i>n</i> is fixed.&nbsp; They show that the set of all cycles generated
by the orders of elimination (for a fixed <i>n</i>) is a group if and only
if 1&lt;<i>n</i>&lt;5.</td>

Josephus Dilemma.&nbsp; In a circle of <i>n</i> men when they eliminate
every third person, the order of elimination defines an <i>(n-3)</i>-Josephus
permutation.&nbsp; They discover and prove fifteen remarkable patterns
in the fixed points of these permutations.</td>

<td>Sarah Burke and Robert Davis also considered another aspect of the
Josephus Problem.&nbsp; Instead of killing all but one person, they considered
killing exactly half of the group, which is distinct from the other half.&nbsp;
For example, suppose there are <i>n</i> bad guys and <i>n</i> good guys
and all the bad guys are killed.&nbsp; Sarah and Robert wrote a program
that will find a skip factor that will achieve this goal for any arbitrary
ordering of bad guys and good guys.</td>
