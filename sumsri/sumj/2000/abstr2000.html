<b>Research Seminars.</b> The most important portion of the program is
the research seminars, where professional mathematicians and statisticians
contribute problems. At least one of the seminar leaders will be an African
American; the other two will be Miami faculty from either the Department
of Mathematics and Statistics or the Department of Systems Analysis. Before
arriving in Oxford, the students are mailed a card listing each seminar
area and prerequisites. They are asked to rank the topics and return the
card. They are then assigned an area based on their choice. We hope to
give each person his or her first choice, but this is not always possible.
During the first four weeks of the program, each seminar director presents
a series of lectures to the seminar participants in their area of expertise
and assign research problems. These problems are challenging and at the
same time easy enough for a very good undergraduate student to get partial
results. Each student chooses a problem to work on and consults the appropriate
professional. The seminar leaders are asked to meet with their students
every day except Friday during the first four weeks and at least twice
a week during the last three weeks. We strongly encourage students to work
in groups. At the end of the program, the students give an oral presentation
on their results and write a paper. The paper will be included in an online
journal published by the Institute.

took a statistical look at the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each year, thousands of federal and state dollars are allocated for STD
education programs, medical treatments, and preventative measures. These
four students used the STD situation to illustrate how multivariate classification
methods can be used. First, they used principal component analysis to simplify
the interpretation and summary of those variables which aid in predicting
STD rates. Principal component analysis allowed them to depict a set of
data using a number of descriptive factors that was less than the number
of variables. They began with measurements of ten racial, ethnic, socioeconomic,
and educational variables for each case and were able to combine them into
four components that provide a clearer picture of the factors that predict
the rate of STDs. Second, using discriminant analysis, they created a model
that consisted of two groups: a group with a high rate of STDs and another
with a low rate of STDs. Members (cases) in each group share similar racial,
ethnic, socioeconomic, and educational variables. Using this discriminant
model, they can predict an unknown observation's group classification.</td>

<td>Dana Thompson and Lawrence Garcia (SUMSRI 2000) examined an extension
of the problem by allowing the position of the home point to vary. They
fixed four points, representing cities, on a Cartesian grid and allowed
the coordinates of the home point to change. For each position, as the
home point moves throughout the plane, the salesman has several possible
paths from which to choose. The path with the shortest length is determined
and called the best path for that home point.&nbsp; They assigned each
possible best path a color and then colored each home point according to
its best&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path, creating colored regions on the
graph. A Matlab program was used to create colored graphs for different
arrangements of the four cities. They chose to examine cases that involved
placing the four points on the grid to form certain quadrilaterals including
a rhombus, a kite, and a trapezoid. Melissa Dejarlais proved in her unpublished
1999 SUMSRI paper that there are four, five, or six distinct best&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
paths for any configuration of four distinct cities. For each of our quadrilaterals,
they examined the conditions necessary for a fifth or sixth color to be
present in the graph.</td>

<td>In the summer of 2000, Betsy LaPlant, Beth McLemore and Victoria Pace
Wood continued this research. A latin transversal is defined as a collection
of n distinct entries of an n&times;n matrix, no two of which are in the
same row or column. They showed that every 4&times;4 submatrix contains
a latin transversal. Additionally, they proved that any n-2&times;n-2 submatrix
contains a latin transversal when n is prime. These results, together with
the previous years findings establish the existence of at least one latin
transversal in any 4&times;4 or smaller submatrix as well as in many n-2&times;n-2
submatrices and any n-1&times;n-1 submatrix of the Z_n Cayley addition
table where n is odd.</td>

<td>Jennifer Hebert looked at the travelling salesman problem for three
cities with the use of Sperner's Lemma in which there is always a coordinate
for homeport where all paths of travel are equal in distance.&nbsp; It
is possible to compute this point (the Sperner Point) in the case that
the cities form an equilateral or an isosceles triangle.&nbsp; However
when the cities are in a scalene formation, the Sperner Point is not easily
computable.&nbsp; Using Newton's Method, a good estimation of the Sperner
Point can be found; with the use of the centroid of the triangle formed
by the cities to fuel Newton's Method, it is possible to always find a
convergent answer.</td>
