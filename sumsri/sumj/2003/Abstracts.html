<p><b>Research Seminars</b><b> </b>are the most important portion of the SUMSRI
program. &nbsp;Professional mathematicians and statisticians contribute problems
and lead seminars. At least one of the seminar leaders is African  American;
the other two are Miami faculty from either the Department of Mathematics
 and Statistics or the Department of Systems Analysis. Before arriving in
Oxford, the students are mailed a card listing each seminar area and prerequisites.
 They are asked to rank the topics and return the card. They are then assigned
 an area based on their choice. We hope to give each person his or her first
 choice, but this is not always possible. During the first four weeks of
the  program, each seminar director presents a series of lectures to the
seminar  participants in their area of expertise and assign research problems.
These  problems are challenging and at the same time easy enough for a very
good  undergraduate student to get partial results. Each student chooses
a problem  to work on and consults the appropriate professional. The seminar
leaders  are asked to meet with their students every day except Friday during
the first four weeks and at least twice a week during the last three weeks.
We strongly encourage students to work in groups. At the end of the program,
the students give an oral presentation on their results and write a paper.
These papers are&nbsp; included in an online journal published by the Institute.<br>

 Analysis   of Stock Trends</font></b> by&nbsp; James Lawrence,    Miami University
and April Kerby,  Alma  College.<br>
  Is there a method to predict the stock market?&nbsp; What factors determine
 if a company&#8217;s stock value will rise or fall in a given year?&nbsp; Using
 the multivariate statistical methods of principal component analysis and
discriminant analysis, we aim to determine an accurate method for classifying
a company&#8217;s stock as a good or a poor investment choice.&nbsp; Additionally,
we will explore the possibilities for reducing the dimensionality of a complex
financial and economic dataset while maintaining the ability to account for
a high percentage of the overall variation in the data.<br>

  Will your favorite National Basketball Association (NBA) team make it to
 the playoffs this year?&nbsp; What variables affect a team&#8217;s postseason
outcome?&nbsp;  In an attempt to determine which teams will make the NBA
playoffs, we will  collect and analyze team data using multivariate statistical
methods including  Principal Components Analysis and Discriminant Analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  In this paper we rediscover the 17 wallpaper groups first classified by 
Fedorov and Sch&ouml;nflies.&nbsp; We explore all lattices and determine their
possible point groups.&nbsp; The point groups then enable us to classify each
distinct wallpaper group.<br>

and Cubeocycles</b></font> &nbsp;<br>
by Lisa Marie Bush, &nbsp;Columbia College<br>
 <br>
 In this paper, we further Doris Schattschneider&#8217;s work on kaleidocycles,
which are three-dimensional rings made from chains of 2<i>n</i> regular tetrahedra
attached at edges.&nbsp; We show that the symmetry group of a kaleidocycle
is&nbsp; $D_n \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$.&nbsp; In addition, we extend kaleidocycles 
to cubeocycles (pronounced &#8220;cube-o-cycles&#8221;), three-dimensional rings made 
from chains of 2<i>n</i> cubes attached at antipodal vertices, and show that
the symmetry group of a cubeocycle is $D_n \oplus Z_2 \oplus D_3$ .<br>

  Using combinatorial methods, M.C. Escher created repeating patterns of
tilings  with decorated squares, hoping to find every possible pattern. In
this paper,  we will give an algebraic proof for his pictorial findings and
then extend  our mathematical approach to a few cases that involve ribbons.<br>

 Scala,   John Carroll University, Andrea Watkins,    Howard University.<br>
  Let <i>G</i> be a countable subset of the real numbers.&nbsp; It is shown
 that if <i>G</i> is a closed set, open set, or <i>F</i>_\sigma set, then
the cardinality of <i>G</i> is the same as the cardinality of the real numbers.&nbsp;
 In particular, the Continuum Hypothesis is true for the basic sets in the
 construction of the Borel sets.<br>
