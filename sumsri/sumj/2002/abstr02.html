<p><b>Research Seminars.</b> The most important portion of the program
is the research seminars, where professional mathematicians and statisticians
contribute problems. At least one of the seminar leaders will be an African
American; the other two will be Miami faculty from either the Department
of Mathematics and Statistics or the Department of Systems Analysis. Before
arriving in Oxford, the students are mailed a card listing each seminar
area and prerequisites. They are asked to rank the topics and return the
card. They are then assigned an area based on their choice. We hope to
give each person his or her first choice, but this is not always possible.
During the first four weeks of the program, each seminar director presents
a series of lectures to the seminar participants in their area of expertise
and assign research problems. These problems are challenging and at the
same time easy enough for a very good undergraduate student to get partial
results. Each student chooses a problem to work on and consults the appropriate
professional. The seminar leaders are asked to meet with their students
every day except Friday during the first four weeks and at least twice
a week during the last three weeks. We strongly encourage students to work
in groups. At the end of the program, the students give an oral presentation
on their results and write a paper. The paper will be included in an online
journal published by the Institute.

<td><b>Variations on Seymour's Conjecture</b>
<br>Kelly Anderson, Catherin Nightingale and Monique Richardson investigated
families of oriented graphs to see if they satisfy Seymour's Conjecture
and to see if stronger claims can be made about the specific graph families.&nbsp;
They verified the conjecture for several families of digraphs and in some
cases proved a stronger claim that every vertex satisfies the conjecture.&nbsp;
Finally they showed that if Seymour's Conjecture holds true for all strong
oriented graphs, then it holds true for all oriented graphs.</td>

<td><b>Pinwheels: Orienting the Line Graph of the Complete Graph</b>
<br>Mary Ann Coleman, Laura Lynch and Lateefah Id-Deen defined a pinwheel
to be a specific king of orientation of the line graph of a complete graph..&nbsp;
They found that every pinwheel is strongly connected, contains a specific
number of Euler tours, and that Seymour's Conjecture is true for every
vertex in any pinwheel.&nbsp; They also gave tight bounds on the number
of 3-cycles possible, the number of spanning trees, and specific eigenvalues
in any particular pinwheel, as well as characterized pinwheels of diameter
2.</td>

<td><b>Multivariate Analysis of Vehicle Safety</b>
<br>Leigh Cobbs, Mary Cunningham and Cheryl Gerde (pictured also with Shenek
Heyward) took commonly available statistics of a large number of popluar
vehicles to create a vehicle safety rating system.&nbsp; They use principle
component analysis to reduce their set of variables to a smaller set of
principal components.&nbsp; Then they used discriminant analysis to classify
vehicles by safety rating using these principal components.</td>

Hayward and David Friedenberg used multivariate statistical analysis techniques
such as discriminant analysis and factor analysis to determine a rule for
classifying countries from a sample into one of two groups, democratic
or non democratic on the basis of 11 variables.&nbsp; They reduced the
dimensionality from 11 variables to a smaller set of underlying factors
that can be used to explain the variation within countries.</td>

<td><b>From Guessing Games to Compact Discs:&nbsp; Some Applications of
Coding Theory</b>
<br>Leslie Calloway, Jacquis Casher and Stacy Hoehn looked at applications
of packings and coverings.&nbsp; They investigated the q-ary hat color
problem, which makes use of both perfect packings and coverings.&nbsp;
In particular, they looked at possible losing sets and strategies for the
cases where there are perfect numbers of players.&nbsp; They made modifications
to the rules of the hat game to increase the winning probability and make
most efficient use of the information gained from configurations in the
losing set.&nbsp; Using the modified rules and the ternary linear Golay
code, they derive a perfect strategy for a team of eleven players and three
hat colors.&nbsp; They also looked at strong coverings as a method to play
the q-ary hat game.</td>

<td><b>Hats Required: Perfect and Imperfect Strategies for the Hat Problem</b>
<br>Didier Deshommes, Andrea Falden and Megan Breit investigated the hat
color problem for both perfect and imperfect team sizes by considering
ways of constructing sets of losing configurations and corresponding strategies.&nbsp;
They also obtain upper bounds for the number of equivalent sets of losing
configurations for both perfect and imperfect team sizes.</td>
