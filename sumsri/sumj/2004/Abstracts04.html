<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Research Seminars</b><b> </b>are the
most important portion of
the SUMSRI
program. &nbsp;Professional mathematicians and statisticians contribute
problems
and lead seminars. At least one of the seminar leaders is African
American;
the other two are Miami faculty from either the Department of
Mathematics and Statistics. Before arriving in
Oxford, the students are mailed a card listing each seminar area and
prerequisites. They are asked to rank the topics and return the card.
They are then assigned an area based on their choice. We hope to give
each person his or her first choice, but this is not always possible.
During the first four weeks of
the program, each seminar director presents a series of lectures to the
seminar participants in their area of expertise and assign research
problems.
These problems are challenging and at the same time easy enough for a
very
good undergraduate student to get partial results. Each student chooses
a problem to work on and consults the appropriate professional. The
seminar
leaders are asked to meet with their students every day except Friday
during
the first four weeks and at least twice a week during the last three
weeks.
We strongly encourage students to work in groups. At the end of the
program,
the students give an oral presentation on their results and write a
paper.
These papers are&nbsp; included in an online <a href="http://www.units.muohio.edu/sumsri/sumj/2004/TOC04.html">Journal</a>
published by the
Institute.&nbsp; (All mathematics between dollar signs is written in
LaTeX mathematical typesetting language.)<br>

Then $\overline \Gamma(\mathbb Z_n)$ represents the complement of

Solutions of Cubic Thue Equations: What Thue Did to Pell</span><br>

It is well-known that cubic Thue equations have finitely many integer
points, and once one associates these equations with elliptic curves,
then there exist algorithms to determine whether they have infinitely
many rational points.&nbsp; In the case of infinitely many rational
solutions, we explain how to explicitly find "large" rational points of
a cubic Thue equation.&nbsp; The paper proceeds as follows.&nbsp;
First, we exhibit a map from the cubic Thue equation <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span> having a rational point of
inflection to an elliptic curve of the form $E:y^2=x^3-D$, then prove
that a "large" rational point on <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span>
maps to a rational point of "approximate" order 3 on <span style="font-style: italic;">E</span>.&nbsp; Second, following an idea
of Zagier, we compute rational points of "approximate" order 3 using
continued fractions of elliptic logarithms.&nbsp; Third, we investigate
how to modify the algorithm by considering homogeneous spaces when a
rational point of inflection does not exist.<br>

Kendall and Ralph classified a city as safe or unsafe by using
multivariate methods of Principal Components, Factor Analysis, and
Discriminant Analysis.&nbsp; In addition, they discover which variables
have salience in the identification of a city being safe or
dangerous.&nbsp; The aforementioned analytical techniques can assist
governments in finding out what variables they need to change to
improve their city and make it a better place to live.<br>

States: A Multivariate Statistical Analysis of Education</span><br>

Educating the population is important in every state.&nbsp; To measure
the quality of education in a state, Nick and Sara examined average
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores.&nbsp; They created a model to predict
future scores based on variables that affect education.&nbsp; First,
they used the multivariate statistical methods of Principal Component
Analysis and Factor Analysis to reduce the number of variables.&nbsp;
Second, they used both of these methods in conjunction with
Discriminant Analysis to create a model that predicts future
scores.&nbsp; Finally, they used the results of Discriminant Analysis
to conjecture how to improve the quality of education.<br>
