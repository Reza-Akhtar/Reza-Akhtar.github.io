<p><b>Research Seminars.</b> The most important portion of the program
is the research seminars, where professional mathematicians and statisticians
contribute problems. At least one of the seminar leaders will be an African
American; the other two will be Miami faculty from either the Department
of Mathematics and Statistics or the Department of Systems Analysis. Before
arriving in Oxford, the students are mailed a card listing each seminar
area and prerequisites. They are asked to rank the topics and return the
card. They are then assigned an area based on their choice. We hope to
give each person his or her first choice, but this is not always possible.
During the first four weeks of the program, each seminar director presents
a series of lectures to the seminar participants in their area of expertise
and assign research problems. These problems are challenging and at the
same time easy enough for a very good undergraduate student to get partial
results. Each student chooses a problem to work on and consults the appropriate
professional. The seminar leaders are asked to meet with their students
every day except Friday during the first four weeks and at least twice
a week during the last three weeks. We strongly encourage students to work
in groups. At the end of the program, the students give an oral presentation
on their results and write a paper. The paper will be included in an online
journal published by the Institute.

determined the desirability of living in any state by using a set of several

analysis and discriminant analysis lend themselves to this issue.&nbsp;
They used factor analysis to reduce a large number of variables to a smaller
set of common factors which describe state desirability.&nbsp; They then
used discriminant analysis to classify states according to their desirability
level based on a set of measured variables.</td>

but we show that even these simple objects have some interesting yet unproved
properties." He then proposed the following conjecture:&nbsp;

proved that any <i>n</i>-2&times;<i>n</i>-2 submatrix contains a latin
transversal when <i>n</i> is prime. These results, together with the previous

in any 4&times;4 or smaller submatrix as well as in many <i>n</i>-2&times;<i>n</i>-2

<p><font size=+1>The <b><font color="#FF0000">Linear Programming</font></b>
seminar students have looked at different aspects of the traveling salesman
problem. The traditional traveling salesman problem involves minimizing
the total distance traveled for a salesman who needs to visit a given number
of cities (visiting each city only once) and then return home.</font>

<td WIDTH="82%">Kathleen Bellino and Rehka Narasimhan examined the case
where a company is interested in building a warehouse or distribution center
that will deliver products to a set of customers on a regular basis. Many
factors are involved when choosing a building site for a warehouse. For
example, the cost of making deliveries from the location site is important.
Thus, for a fixed number of clients, the company might want to know the
cost of supplying them with a product from several potential warehouse
sites. If there are <i>n</i> customers, this requires the solution of a
traveling salesman problem to <i>n</i> cities from various starting points.
This motivates one to consider the following problem. Let <i>(ai,bi)</i>
denote the location of city <i>i</i> in the <i>xy</i> plane, and let <i>H
= (x,y)</i> denote a movable point in the plane, which we will refer to
as the home point. For each position of <i>H</i>, solve the traveling salesman
problem, which starts at <i>H</i>, visits the n cities, and returns to
<i>H</i>.
Now, color the points in the plane so that two points get the same color
if their traveling salesman tours visit the cities in the same order. Clearly,
only a finite number of colors will be required for any
<i>n</i>. Kathleen
and Rehka determined some interesting properties of the regions defined
by these colors.</td>

of 4 cities in three-dimensional space with a movable homeport. By assigning
a unique color to each of the optimal tours, and coloring the homepoint
with the color of the tour that is optimal for that home point, for each
homepoint in three-dimensional space, some interesting determinations can
be made about the nature of the colored regions.</td>

</td>

<td WIDTH="82%">Dana Thompson and Lawrence Garcia (SUMSRI 2000) examined
an extension of the problem by allowing the position of the home point
to vary. They fixed four points, representing cities, on a Cartesian grid
and allowed the coordinates of the home point to change. For each position,
as the home point moves throughout the plane, the salesman has several
possible paths from which to choose. The path with the shortest length
is determined and called the best path for that home point. They assigned
each possible best path a color and then colored each home point according
to its best path, creating colored regions on the graph. A Matlab program
was used to create colored graphs for different arrangements of the four
cities. They chose to examine cases that involved placing the four points
on the grid to form certain quadrilaterals including a rhombus, a kite,
and a trapezoid. Melissa Dejarlais proved in her unpublished 1999 SUMSRI
paper that there are four, five, or six distinct best paths for any configuration
of four distinct cities. For each of our quadrilaterals, they examined
the conditions necessary for a fifth or sixth color to be present in the
graph.</td>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td WIDTH="69%">In 1999, Rebekkah Dann, Lynn Holmes, Rachel Kahlenberg
and Bethany Lyles used the randomized response method to look at how many
students might cheat on tests using graphing calculators. Graphing calculators
allow students to perform tedious mathematical calculations with great
ease and considerably shorten the amount of time needed to work some difficult
problems. However, it is possible to store information, such as formulas
or definitions, in graphing calculators and use this information to cheat
on exams. In order to address this issue, an unrelated-question randomized
response experiment was conducted at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.
To compare the percentages of students that have cheated on exams using
graphing calculators among different departments, samples were taken from
among mathematics, chemistry, and physics students. The unrelated-question
randomized response method applies to this situation because some people
may feel uncomfortable responding truthfully to direct statements regarding
sensitive issues, such as cheating on exams. Relative to standard randomized
response, this method yields a smaller variance. The smaller variance given
by the unrelated-question randomized response method allows a shorter confidence
interval to be constructed.</td>

Porter and Michael Sotelo took a statistical look at the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases. Each year, thousands of federal and state dollars
are allocated for STD education programs, medical treatments, and preventative
measures. These four students used the STD situation to illustrate how
multivariate classification methods can be used. First, they used principal
component analysis to simplify the interpretation and summary of those
variables which aid in predicting STD rates. Principal component analysis
allowed them to depict a set of data using a number of descriptive factors
that was less than the number of variables. They began with measurements
of ten racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and educational variables for each
case and were able to combine them into four components that provide a
clearer picture of the factors that predict the rate of STDs. Second, using
discriminant analysis, they created a model that consisted of two groups:
a group with a high rate of STDs and another with a low rate of STDs. Members
(cases) in each group share similar racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and
educational variables. Using this discriminant model, they can predict
an unknown observation's group classification.</td>
